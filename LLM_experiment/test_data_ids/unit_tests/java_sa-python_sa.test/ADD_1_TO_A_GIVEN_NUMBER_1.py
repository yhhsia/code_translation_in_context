def f_filled ( x ): return -( ~ x )
```This Python code does the same thing as the given C++ code, which is to add one to an integer value.However, it's important to note that the C++ code `f_filled` function is not actually adding one to the input, but rather returning the bitwise complement of the input and then adding one to it.This is not a typical way to implement
